```

## Beaver Data

```{r}
plot(beaver1$temp)
```

This plot shows series of beaver's tempurature over time. Note that the time variable is not included here. The measurements are just shown in series.
The plot suggests a cyclical pattern with the tempurature of the beaver.

```{r}
plot(EuStockMarkets)
```
This shows the daily closing prices of EU stock indices between 1991 and 1998 according to the help file. There is a clear upward trend over time in the value of each index. It's a good idea to invest in indices instead of picking your own stocks unless you really really know what you are doing!
